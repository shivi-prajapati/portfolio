1.MS Office<br>
<img src="mslogo.PNG"/><p>Microsoft Office, or simply Office, is a family of client software, server software, and services developed by Microsoft.<br>
 It was first announced by Bill Gates on August 1, 1988, at COMDEX in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for an office suite (bundled set of<br>
 productivity applications), the first version of Office contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint. Over the years, <br>
Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, Object Linking and Embedding data integration<br>
 and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the<br>
 Office Business Applications brand.</p><br>
2.C,C++<br>
<img src="c logo.PNG" width="200"/>&nbsp<img src="c++ logo.PNG" width="200"/><p>C++ (or “C-plus-plus”) is a generic programming language for building software.<br>
 It’s an object-oriented language. In other words, it emphasizes using data fields with unique attributes (a.k.a. objects) rather than logic or functions.<br>
 A common example of an object is a user account on a website. Typically, a user account contains closely related data like first name, last name,<br>
 and email address. Bundling this information together into an object makes it easy to replicate the process of creating a new account.</p><br>
3.HTML<br>
<img src="img1.jpg" width="300"/><p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display<br>
 on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.Each individual piece markup code (which would fall<br>
 between "<" and ">" characters) is referred to as an element, though many people also refer to it as a tag. Some elements come in pairs that indicate<br>
 when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.</p><br>
